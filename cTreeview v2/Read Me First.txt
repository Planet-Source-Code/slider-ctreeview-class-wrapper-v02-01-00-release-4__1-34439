cTREEVIEW Class Wrapper / DLL - Version 2.0.0
---------------------------------------------

Welcome to the latest release of the cTreeview class designed to simply the
TreeView control usablility plus add new functionality. (View cTreeView
History.Txt for a list of features that have been added.) Four tutorial
applications have also been included to help learn how to use most features
found the class wrapper.

Just some quick notes to get you started:-

1. Before loading any of the projects into the IDE, the DLL must be extreated
   and registered. There is a zip file in the '.\cTreeview\Runtime'
   directory. Unzip the files into the directory and register the vbTree.DLL
   file ($System$\regsvr32 $Install_Dir$\cTreeview\Runtime\vbTree.DLL.
   Directory must be 8.3 format [Where $System$ = Windows System Directory &
   $Install_Dir$ is the host drive and directory for the cTreeview directory
   (e.g. c:\Windows\System\regsvr32
         c:\MyProj~1\cTreeView\Runtime\vbTree.DLL {on the same line})].

2. Each tutorial directory has three ways of loading: a) Tutorial?.vbp; b)
   Tutorial?_inc_VbTree.vbg; c) Tutorial?_NODLL.vbp. Method a) will load the
   tutorial with a reference to the vbTree.DLL; method b) is a project group
   that will load both the tutorial & the vbTree DLL source; and method c)
   loads the tutorial and the cTREEVIEW Class Wrapper files as a single
   project with no vbTree.DLL dependancy.

   The third method causes the cTreeview.cls & iMultiSelect.cls classes to
   change thier instances to Private. So make sure that you read the headers
   of these files to alter the instancing depending on the type of compile
   being used.

3. In the .\cTreeview\Resources\Help directory is an Xml document created by
   MZTools (http://www.mztools.com) that can be viewed in a Web Browser that
   outlines all of the properties and methods of all vbTree.DLL classes.

4. In creating these projects, I've used some external libraries. They are: 
   Microsoft XML v3.0 (DLLs), Microsoft ADO v2.5 (DLLs), Microsoft Windows
   Common Controls 6.0 SP4 (OCX).

5. For those who have used the earlier versions of the cTreeView Wrapper 
   class, be aware that there have been some changes that break 
   compatability with the earlier versions. They are as follows:-
	a. 'CutIconState' was a function. This is now a Read/Write property
           called 'CutIcon'. 
	b. 'NodeFirstViewable' was a function. This is now a Read/Write
           property called 'FirstVisibleNode'.
	c. 'NodeLastViewable' was a function. This is now a Read only
           property called 'LastVisibleNode'.
	d. Event: 'CopyNode' now has an additional field called 'Cancel'.
           This is now used instead of write only property 'CancelCopy'.
        e. 'NodeDelete' method has a new field 'bIncludeChildren' (Default
           = True). If 'bIncludeChildren' is false, only the nominated node
           will be deleted and the child nodes will move up in nesting
           levels. (See Tutorial 1) i.e. to the node's parent.

Enjoy!
